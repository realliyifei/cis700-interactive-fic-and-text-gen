What types of stories is COMET-ATOMIC *bad* at tracking?\n","\n","COMET-ATOMIC is generally bad at tracking: (1) stories that jump too fast or lack logic. (2) stories that have a very complicated narrative or alien background. Also, since the given sentence parser is not good at extracting the pronoun as `PersonX' or `PersonY' so the stories which are full of pronoun-only sentences are not suitable at this system. For example, in the 3rd story, the subject switches from Amy to the girl and the girls, and the parser cannot extract the girls as the subject and referring to Amy and the girl.\n","\n","   2a. Do you think any of the other knowledge bases mentioned in class could better model these?\n","\n","   GPT-3 can work as complementary module to address these issues, due to its causal generation ability.
