        "> We introduce a large-scale crowdsourced text adventure game as a research platform for studying grounded dialogue. In it, agents can perceive, emote, and act while conducting dialogue with other agents. Models and humans can both act as characters within the game. We describe the results of training state-of-the-art generative and retrieval models in this setting. We show that in addition to using past dialogue, these models are able to effectively use the state of the underlying world to condition their predictions. In particular, we show that grounding on the details of the local environment, including location descriptions, and the objects (and their affordances) and characters (and their previous actions) present within it allows better predictions of agent behavior and dialogue. We analyze the ingredients necessary for successful grounding in this setting, and how each of these factors relate to agents that can talk and act successfully.\n",

            "Description: Deep inside the volcanic cave that is the foundation of the aquapolis lies the treasury.  Some believe its existence is a myth, but others claim they have been there.  Those that claim they have seen it say you must dive out of the aquapolis' basement while holding your breath, through the cold deep water that is filled with deadly volcanic gas.  The treasury room itself is a dry cave filled with riches from the very infancy of the empire\n",

Indeed, the market is quite crowded, with merchants as likely setting up stalls upside down on the ceiling as on the floor.  Colorful dyes are used around some of the more exotic booths, the color clouding the water and drawing the eye to it.  High shrills pierce the waters as various merchants call out their wares to the merpeoples passing by.\n",

            "Description: Toad Hollow is a filthy room within the Underwater Aquapolis. When you enter, you are greeted by the reek of scummy pond water. You enter Toad Hollow through a drainage pipe that you have to crawl through. Once inside Toad Hollow, you can stand up, but you still don't feel comfortable with your surroundings. As far as the eye can see there is muddy water in a circular basin with lily pads floating in it. On the pads, giant toads jump back and forth making gurgling, croaking sounds. As you wade deeper into Toad Hollow, the water comes up to your waist and you see the flash of a fin. There is legend that a creature lives in the center of Toad Hollow that is half human, half monster. Not even the strongest knight has been brave enough to examine it. The fin disappears back underwater but there is a red glint suggesting eyes are watching you. When you reach the other side of the basin, you crawl into another drainage pipe and feel relieved that you're out of this place.\n",

Bits of music sound occasionally, tunes that seem familiar and yet quite alien, as though played by someone who had only heard the melody described to them, instead of hearing it themselves.  And yet all this pales in comparison to the pool found in the center.  The water gleams silver, seemingly absorbing and reflecting back the light of the trees around it tenfold.  Though there is a soft breeze that blows through the glade, there is not a ripple to be seen on the water's perfectly mirrored surface.\n",

As far as the eye can see there is muddy water in a circular basin with lily pads floating in it. On the pads, giant toads jump back and forth making gurgling, croaking sounds. As you wade deeper into Toad Hollow, the water comes up to your waist and you see the flash of a fin. There is legend that a creature lives in the center of Toad Hollow that is half human, half monster. Not even the strongest knight has been brave enough to examine it. The fin disappears back underwater but there is a red glint suggesting eyes are watching you.
